# SQL Library Manager

For this project I have been tasked to create an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books.

I've built a web application that will include pages to list, add, update and delete books. This web application uses the express.js framework for routing and communication between the SqLite database and the SQL ORM Sequelize framework.

### How to use this app?

In order to be able to use this project, tn the project directory you will have to install the dependencies first.
This can be done with:

```
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies you can start the application by running the following command:

```
npm start
```
